# elif-practice
This program, written in Python, is a modification of a much more rudimentary elif practice example presented in *Chapter 2: Flow Control* of the book [*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).

I had a lot of fun making the program my own by applying all that I learned about assigning values to variables, relational operators, evaluating down to a single Boolean value, and converting strings into integers.  I also applied something I learned in my GDI Python class, the built-in method `name.title()` to capitalize the input.

This mini project was very empowering!  It really helped me feel a sense of control and accomplishment!  This book is highly engaging.  The examples are comical; I frequently laugh out loud while practicing. The flow charts in chapter 2 are extremely helpful in teaching me logic.  I'm looking forward to completing the free 15 chapters, and I probably will purchase the ebook to access the remaining chapters as well.
