# elif Practice
Description: This program, written in Python 3.10.4, is a modification of a much more rudimentary elif practice example presented in *Chapter 2: Flow Control* of the book [*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).

## Overview
I had a lot of fun making the program my own by applying all that I learned about assigning values to variables, relational operators, evaluating down to a single Boolean value, and converting strings into integers.  I also applied something I learned in my GDI Python class, the built-in method `name.title()` to capitalize the input.

## My process



### Built with

- Python 3.10.4

### What I learned

This mini project was very empowering!  It really helped me feel a sense of control and accomplishment!  This book is highly engaging.  The examples are comical; I frequently laugh out loud while practicing. The flow charts in chapter 2 are extremely helpful in teaching me logic.  

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to completing all 20 chapters of the book. In the introduction, it says that there are practice projects that challenge you to improve the practice programs and inspire you to automate similar tasks, so I'm excited to work on those, and update my progress, here on Github. I am also interested in another book by Sweigart: [*The Big Book of Small Python Projects*](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/).
